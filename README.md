# QiU

QiU is a free Open Source solution to automate and grow whatever you want, wherever you are. 



#### The Idea :
* Create a PCB that can sense and control everything you need to grow whatever you want
* Cheap, Easy to find and repair components
* Simple to implement
* Future Proof
* Open source


## Why?

#### TL;DR

There isn't enough food, and climate change + soil erosion will make farming production a nightmare for most of the population.

#### TS;WM
* The earth eventually will have to support around 12Bn people. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projections_of_population_growth) 
* we have to grow in the next 30 years the same amount of food that in the past 10.000 years combined.
* Fertile land is reducing really fast. 60% less land by 2070 [EU Science Hub](https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/news/global-soil-erosion-projected-be-worse-previously-expected)

## Uff. Let's solve it
